NESL RELEASE 3.0 

BASIC INFORMATION:

NESL is a fine-grained, functional, nested data-parallel language.
The current implementation runs on workstations, the Connection
Machines CM2 and CM5, and the Cray Y-MP (8, C90 and EL).  NESL code is
fully portable across these machines, and for many applications it
achieves performance comparable to machine specific code.  The
implementation is based on an intermediate language called VCODE and a
low-level vector library called CVL.

HOW TO GET THE DISTRIBUTION:

The full NESL distribution can be obtained via anonymous FTP from:

   nesl.scandal.cs.cmu.edu:code/nesl/nesl.tar.Z
        (If you have AFS, the release can also be obtained from:
         /afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/scandal/public/code/nesl/nesl.tar.Z)

Once copied over to your machine, it can be unpacked by running:

  uncompress -c nesl.tar.Z | tar -xf -

This will create a directory called nesl in your current directory
with the full distribution within that directory.  Building an
executable version of NESL is straightforward.

REQUIREMENTS:

To run NESL you will need either Allegro, CMU, Kyoto or Lucid Common
Lisp.  CMU and Kyoto are available as free software: send mail to
wfs@math.utexas.edu for information on AKCL, or slisp@cs.cmu.edu for
information on CMU-CL.

You will also need an ANSI C compiler, a unix-like operating system
(Mach, unicos... work fine), and if you want the graphics routines,
you will need an X11 library.

DISTRIBUTION CONTENTS:

The current nesl distribution file (nesl.tar.Z) is approximately 1.3
Megabytes (compressed), and includes the following:

MAILING LIST:

You can be placed on the nesl mailing list by sending a request
to nesl-request@cs.cmu.edu.

BUGS:

You can send bug reports to nesl-bugs@cs.cmu.edu.  It should be noted
that NESL is a research tool rather than a production system.  We will
try to respond to your bugs as quickly as possible, but make no
guarantees.
