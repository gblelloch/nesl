This project comprises Lambda functions for running the interpreter of NESL language 
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/nesl.html) on AWS Lambda, either directly or via API Gateway
Deployed to AWS Lambda using serverless.com tool:
  $ sls deploy
Then copy the reported API Gateway URL to the HTML form, as a POST action
with a single input field (e.g., named 'program') containing the input NESL program, e.g.:
  {a * a : a in [3, -4, -9, 5] | a > 0};
